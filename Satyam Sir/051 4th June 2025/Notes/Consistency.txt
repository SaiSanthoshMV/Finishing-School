Consistency means:
A transaction must take the database from one valid state to another valid state, 
without breaking any rules.

The database should always follow its rules (like constraints, formats, balances, etc.) 
before and after the transaction.

Simple Explanation:
Think of Consistency as a promise:
"No matter what happens in a transaction, the rules of the database are never broken."

It’s like saying:
If money is deducted from one account, it must be added to another (no missing money).
If a column cannot be NULL, no transaction should leave it NULL.

Real-Life Bank Example:
Two accounts:
A: ₹10,000
B: ₹5,000

Transaction: Transfer ₹2,000 from A to B.

-- Step 1: A loses ₹2,000
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 2000 WHERE acc_no = 'A';

-- Step 2: B gains ₹2,000
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 2000 WHERE acc_no = 'B';

Total before: ₹10,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹15,000
Total after:	  ₹8,000 + ₹7,000 = ₹15,000 

This is consistent.

But if only A gets deducted and B does not get credited:

New total =     ₹8,000 +  ₹5,000 = ₹13,000 
Money disappears → violates consistency

Other Rules Consistency Protects:
Foreign key rules
Check constraints (like age > 0)
Unique keys, etc.
