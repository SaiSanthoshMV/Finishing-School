// In the quiet town of Eldoria, a famous treasure was said to be hidden somewhere, waiting to be discovered. 
// Many adventurers had tried to find it, but none had succeeded. 
// One day, two explorers, Arin and Mira, discovered an ancient scroll in the town library.

// The scroll contained a long passage filled with cryptic words. 
// The legend said that the treasure's location could only be revealed if they correctly determined 
// the shortest distance between two special words in the passage.

// They read the passage carefully:
// "The old castle stood on the highest hill, where knights once trained with their mighty swords. 
// A golden key was hidden under the ancient oak tree, and the villagers often spoke of its mysterious glow. 
// Legends told of a secret passage deep beneath the ground, leading to the lost chest that contained priceless jewels and forgotten artifacts."

// Mira pointed at the scroll excitedly. "We need to find the word 'key' and the word 'chest' and count the words between them!"

// Arin quickly scanned the passage. 
// The word "key" appeared at position 19, and the word "chest" was at position 50.
// "The shortest distance between them is 30 words!" he exclaimed.

// The moment he spoke the answer, the scroll shimmered, and a hidden compartment in the library wall slid open. 
// Inside, they found an old map leading them to the treasure buried deep within the Whispering Woods.

// Their journey had just begun, but thanks to their keen observation and ability to measure the shortest path between two words, 
// they were one step closer to uncovering Eldoriaâ€™s greatest mystery!

// Example 1:
// Input =apple banana cherry goa apple watermelon juice date
// apple date
// Output = 2
